Attrition, in Human Resource terminology, refers to the phenomenon of the employees leaving the company.
Attrition in a company is usually measured with a metric called attrition rate, which simply measures the no
of employees moving out of the company (voluntary resigning or laid off by the company). Attrition Rate is
also referred as churn rate or turnover.
High attrition is a cause of concern for a company as it presents a cost to the company. The company loses
on the amount it spent to recruit and select these employees and to train them for their respective jobs. The
company may also have to spend additional money to fill the vacancies left open by these employees. Hence
it becomes critical for a company to keep a tab on the attrition rate which downsizes the employee base.
Now it is possible not only to predict unwanted attrition, but also to have action plans to help reduce it,
based on the organization’s unique attributes.
With Machine Learning, it is possible to gain more insight than ever before into employee engagement, and
build action plans to reduce unwanted attrition and achieve the organization’s business goals.
